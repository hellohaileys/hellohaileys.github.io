      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;ve just gotten engaged and you wake up with the biggest smile as you look at that gorgeous ring on your finger! That&amp;rsquo;s before the rush of wedding planning has begun&amp;hellip;

I never understood why wedding planners had a job. I assumed it was just another way for people to splurge on weddings. That&amp;rsquo;s until Jordan and I had to plan our own.
The months leading up to your wedding has well meaning people continually asking you how planning a wedding is going.</description>

      <description>Whether you&amp;rsquo;re going through a natural hair journey or not, having healthy hair is important because your hair is the crown you never take off.

Although I agree with India Arie emphasising &amp;ldquo;she is not her hair&amp;rdquo;, hair is a beautiful thing and the variety of hair colours and textures are what add to our uniqueness, so just like the rest of our body, it would make sense to want to take care of it and have it in a healthy state.</description>

      <description>If California is for dreamers, catch me sleeping.

(Continuing on from our last story, where we stopped in Jacksonville, which you can read about here&amp;hellip;)
Ever since I arrived to Portland in January, it&amp;rsquo;s been cloudy and rainy. So you can imagine how thrilled I was to go to California, where the sunshine and vitamin D is abundant.

When visiting a place, I like to see how the locals see it, as well as the tourist areas.</description>

      <title>Road Trip Through Oregon</title>

      <description>Last Month, Jordan and I were able to set out on our first road trip from Oregon down to California. We didn&amp;rsquo;t realize how fun the stop along the way would be.
Driving down from Oregon to California is a 13+ hour drive. Basically the distance from Johannesburg to Cape Town in South Africa. That&amp;rsquo;s when I really realised how big America is.
The first stop we made was in Jacksonville, Oregon.</description>

      <description>Hey there! So&amp;hellip;our blog is finally up! I&amp;rsquo;d been toying with the idea for years, and finally last September, while Jordan and I were still in a long distance relationship I sent him a text, finally admitting to myself that I wanted to start a blog one day.
Six months later, the idea has finally come together. I always wanted to blog about curly hair. I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about natural hair and felt all my trial and error experiences could be passed on to other curly girls.</description>

      <title>D&#39;s Hair Routine</title>
      <link>https://hellohaileys.github.io/blog/2018/03/08-hair_routine/</link>

      <description>Most naturalistas are hair junkies. Not necessarily because we&amp;rsquo;re hoarders, but because we&amp;rsquo;re constantly on the lookout for the next &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; hair product. Something that&amp;rsquo;s gonna save us time and give our hair that perfect bounce&amp;hellip;
I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s possible to reach that point of being perfectly happy with our hair. Personally, even on good hair days I could walk into a shop, see a new product, and think &amp;ldquo;maybe this is going to revolutionise the way I do my hair&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>He&#39;s Gotta Love Your Natural Hair</title>

      <description>I remember the night I met Jordan. I had just cut my hair pretty short and was attempting to rock corn rows on the side with the rest of my curls. The hair cut didn&amp;rsquo;t quite go as planned andÂ I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I was looking my prettiest.
The sweet thing is, when it&amp;rsquo;s his turn to retell the story about how we met, it goes something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;I saw this cute curly girl who I thought I&amp;rsquo;d probably never see again&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;.</description>
