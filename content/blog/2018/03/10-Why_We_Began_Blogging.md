Hey there! So...our blog is finally up! I'd been toying with the idea for years, and finally last September, while Jordan and I were still in a long distance relationship I sent him a text, finally admitting to myself that I wanted to start a blog one day.

Six months later, the idea has finally come together. I always wanted to blog about curly hair. I'm passionate about natural hair and felt all my trial and error experiences could be passed on to other curly girls. Often I'd get stopped in the street by people asking to touch my hair, or for hair advice. If only I had a blog to reference them to.

Then I got married, moved away from home and started the process of adapting to married life in a new country. I needed a hobby, one that would allow me to unleash my creativity. And I've definitely been having fun with the process.

Here are some pros to blogging if you're considering starting one of your own:

**1. It's a modern way of being creative.**

You get to be creative with your blog by setting it up in a style that reflects your personality and creating content that you enjoy. You don't have to stick to one topic, it's YOUR blog, so you can literally blog about anything that interests you.

**2. It makes you a better writer and an author.**

You might never get the chance to write a book, but you could be the author of your own blog article(s) and improve your way of writing in the process.

**3. It helps you keep in touch with your friends and family.**

If you have a cooking blog, people can keep up with your cooking and recipes, if you have a lifestyle blog, people can keep up with what you're doing in your free time. Your first readers and supporters will most likely be your close friends and family.

**4. You become a better photographer / photo taker.**

We aren't photographers, but we do enjoy taking pictures. While planning our blog we researched and practiced photography techniques, and we still have a lot to learn. All that being said, it's a fun and useful skill to have!

**5. It's free.**

There are several content management systems (blogging sites) that are free to use, such as Blogger, Tumblr, WordPress, etc.

**6. You improve your web development abilities.**

Jordan used to make his own websites as a hobby. Blogging with me has helped us both learn more about web design. Should you not want to go the blogging sites route, you could learn web design and design your own blog.

**7. You'll make the internet a "better place".**

There's a lot of junk and nonsense on the internet. So having another wholesome website added makes the internet more helpful and enjoyable.

**8. It could pay off.**

Having a blog could impress a future employer when they search for your name online or get you started in being an entrepreneur should you wish to promote your brand online. If you have a business, in this day and age, it's very useful having an internet presence.

So yeah, blogging might just be for you too.
