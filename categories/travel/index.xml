      <description>If California is for dreamers, catch me sleeping.

(Continuing on from our last story, where we stopped in Jacksonville, which you can read about here&amp;hellip;)
Ever since I arrived to Portland in January, it&amp;rsquo;s been cloudy and rainy. So you can imagine how thrilled I was to go to California, where the sunshine and vitamin D is abundant.

When visiting a place, I like to see how the locals see it, as well as the tourist areas.</description>

      <description>Last Month, Jordan and I were able to set out on our first road trip from Oregon down to California. We didn&amp;rsquo;t realize how fun the stop along the way would be.
Driving down from Oregon to California is a 13+ hour drive. Basically the distance from Johannesburg to Cape Town in South Africa. That&amp;rsquo;s when I really realised how big America is.
The first stop we made was in Jacksonville, Oregon.</description>
