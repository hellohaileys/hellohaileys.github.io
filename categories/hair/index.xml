      <description>Whether you&amp;rsquo;re going through a natural hair journey or not, having healthy hair is important because your hair is the crown you never take off.

Although I agree with India Arie emphasising &amp;ldquo;she is not her hair&amp;rdquo;, hair is a beautiful thing and the variety of hair colours and textures are what add to our uniqueness, so just like the rest of our body, it would make sense to want to take care of it and have it in a healthy state.</description>

      <description>Most naturalistas are hair junkies. Not necessarily because we&amp;rsquo;re hoarders, but because we&amp;rsquo;re constantly on the lookout for the next &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; hair product. Something that&amp;rsquo;s gonna save us time and give our hair that perfect bounce&amp;hellip;
I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s possible to reach that point of being perfectly happy with our hair. Personally, even on good hair days I could walk into a shop, see a new product, and think &amp;ldquo;maybe this is going to revolutionise the way I do my hair&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I remember the night I met Jordan. I had just cut my hair pretty short and was attempting to rock corn rows on the side with the rest of my curls. The hair cut didn&amp;rsquo;t quite go as planned andÂ I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I was looking my prettiest.
The sweet thing is, when it&amp;rsquo;s his turn to retell the story about how we met, it goes something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;I saw this cute curly girl who I thought I&amp;rsquo;d probably never see again&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;.</description>
