      <description>Hey there!
So&amp;hellip;our blog is finally up!
I&amp;rsquo;d been toying with the idea for years, and finally last September, while Jordan and I were still in a long distance relationship I sent him a text, finally admitting to myself that I wanted to start a blog one day.
6 Months later, the idea has finally come together. I always wanted to blog about curly hair. I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about natural hair and felt all my trial and error experiences could be passed on to other curly girls.</description>
