      <description>Last Month, Jordan and I were able to set out on our first road trip from Oregon down to California. We didn&amp;rsquo;t realize how fun the stop along the way would be.
Driving down from Oregon to California is a 13+ hour drive. Basically the distance from Johannesburg to Cape Town in South Africa. That&amp;rsquo;s when I really realised how big America is.
The first stop we made was in Jacksonville, Oregon.</description>
