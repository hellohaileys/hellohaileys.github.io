      <description>I remember the night I met Jordan. I had just cut my hair pretty short and was attempting to rock corn rows on the side with the rest of my curls. The hair cut didn&amp;rsquo;t quite go as planned andÂ I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I was looking my prettiest.
The sweet thing is, when it&amp;rsquo;s his turn to retell the story about how we met, it goes something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;I saw this cute curly girl who I thought I&amp;rsquo;d probably never see again&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;.</description>
